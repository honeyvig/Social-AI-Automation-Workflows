====================
Hereâ€™s a Python-based framework to help implement automation workflows as described in the job posting. The framework uses libraries and services to integrate Make.com (via its API), AI-generated video tools, and Airtable.
Prerequisites

    Install required libraries:

    pip install requests pandas

    Set up API keys for the platforms:
        Obtain API keys for Make.com, Airtable, and an AI video tool like Synthesia or Lumen5.
        Configure access to social media APIs like Facebook Graph API or Twitter Developer API for posting.

        return pd.DataFrame([record['fields'] for record in records])

# Example workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fetch Airtable data

    if campaigns is not None:

            # Generate AI video
            video_url = create_ai_video(row["Script"], title=row["Title"])
            
            # Create Make.com scenario
            make_data = {
                "steps": [
                    {"type": "fetch", "url": video_url},

            create_make_scenario(make_data)
            
            # Post to social media (e.g., Facebook)
            post_to_social_media("facebook", row["Content"], "your_facebook_access_token")

How It Works

    Airtable for Campaign Data:
        Pulls content calendar, scripts, and other relevant details.
    AI Video Generation:
        Leverages tools like Synthesia to create engaging video content.
    Make.com Integration:
        Automates workflows to fetch, post, and manage content delivery.
    Social Media Posting:
        Posts directly to platforms like Facebook or Twitter via APIs.

Extendability

    Reporting: Add functionality to fetch analytics from social media platforms for performance tracking.
    Additional Platforms: Expand to Instagram, LinkedIn, or TikTok via their respective APIs.
    Error Handling: Improve error logging and retry mechanisms for API calls.
